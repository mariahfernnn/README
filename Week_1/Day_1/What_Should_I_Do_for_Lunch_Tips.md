### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (hungry && availableTime < 20) {
    console.log("Pick something up and eat in back in the Lab or in the kitchen, where you can get to know your fellow classmates.");
  } else if (hungry && availableTime === 20 && availableTime <= 30) {
    console.log("You deserve a break and could try a place in Gastown.");
  } else if (hungry && availableTime > 30) {
    console.log("This is a bootcamp after all and you should probably reconsider.");
  } else {
    console.log("Get back to work!");
  }
};

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
